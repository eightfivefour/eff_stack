## MVC Structure

- **Views**: [app/views](mdc:app/views/) - Traditional ERB templates and ViewComponents
- **Controllers**: [app/controllers](mdc:app/controllers/) - Action controllers

## Database

- PostgreSQL database
- ActiveRecord ORM
- Migrations in [db/migrate](mdc:db/migrate/)

## API

- JSON responses built with Jbuilder
- API controllers would be in [app/controllers](mdc:app/controllers/)

## Background Jobs

- ActiveJob framework
- Job classes in [app/jobs](mdc:app/jobs/)

## Testing

- RSpec for testing: [spec](mdc:spec/)
- FactoryBot for test data
