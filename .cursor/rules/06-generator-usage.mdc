# Generator Usage Guidelines

## Always Use Available Generators

- **Always check if a generator exists before creating files manually.** Rails and this project provide several generators that create files with proper structure and naming conventions.
- Run `bin/rails generate` to see a list of all available generators.
- Before creating any new component, model, controller, or other file, first check if there's a generator for it.

## Common Generators

- `bin/rails generate view_component NAME [attribute:type]...` - Create a new ViewComponent
- `bin/rails generate model NAME [field:type]...` - Create a new model
- `bin/rails generate controller NAME [action]...` - Create a new controller
- `bin/rails generate stimulus NAME [action]...` - Create a new Stimulus controller
- `bin/rails generate job NAME` - Create a new background job

## Generator Benefits

- Ensures consistent file structure and naming
- Creates associated test files automatically
- Follows project conventions
- Saves time and reduces errors

## Customizing Generated Code

If you need to customize code created by generators:
1. Generate the files first
2. Then modify the generated code as needed
3. Never bypass generators for convenience
