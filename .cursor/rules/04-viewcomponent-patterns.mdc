# ViewComponent Patterns

This application uses ViewComponent to create reusable, testable, and encapsulated view components.

## Component Structure

Components are located in [app/frontend/components](mdc:app/frontend/components/) and follow this structure:

- Component directory, e.g., `button/`
  - `component.rb` - Ruby class defining props and behavior
  - `component.html.erb` - Template
  - `preview.rb` - Preview class for component playground

## Base Components

- [ApplicationViewComponent](mdc:app/frontend/components/application_view_component.rb) - Base class for all components
- [ApplicationViewComponentPreview](mdc:app/frontend/components/application_view_component_preview.rb) - Base preview class

## Generator

The application includes a custom component generator:
```ruby
rails generate view_component NAME [attribute:type]...
```

This generator creates the component files in [app/frontend/components](mdc:app/frontend/components/) based on templates in [lib/generators/view_component/templates](mdc:lib/generators/view_component/templates/).

## Lookbook Integration

Components can be previewed in development using the Lookbook gem at `/lookbook`.
