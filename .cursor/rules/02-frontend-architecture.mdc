# Frontend Architecture

This application uses a modern frontend stack with Vite, ViewComponent, Stimulus, and Turbo.

## Main Technologies

- **Vite**: Used for bundling JavaScript assets with [vite_rails](mdc:app/frontend/entrypoints)
- **ViewComponent**: Component-based view approach in [app/frontend/components](mdc:app/frontend/components)
- **Stimulus**: JavaScript framework for "just enough JavaScript"
- **Turbo**: Makes navigating your web application faster

## Component Structure

Components follow the ViewComponent pattern:
- Each component has its own directory with component.rb and component.html.erb files
- Component previews are available for visual testing
- Base components inherit from [ApplicationViewComponent](mdc:app/frontend/components/application_view_component.rb)

## Asset Handling

- JavaScript and CSS are processed through Vite
- Entry points are in [app/frontend/entrypoints](mdc:app/frontend/entrypoints)
- Tailwind CSS is used for styling
